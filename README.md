# ChatShack
Dalton and Ali's final project for computer networks. A fully functioning server-client chatroom application that runs our class's custom made chatroom protocol. 

To run the server run this command in your terminal:

java ChatShackServer

to run the client run this command in you terminal:

java bigG [ip address] [your username]


## instructions for the gui

after the gui starts click on join to actually join the chat.
if you click on send before writing anything in the comment box it will not work.
once your interface recognizes some other user it will add it to the scroll box next to the send button.
you can send private messages to other users that you can see in the scroll box.
once you leave the chat the gui will close and the client program will quit.
